## Sumamry ##

Repository for Hackerrank solutions for functional programming.

In progress since most solutions still missing (or too simple to bother uploading).

All solutions achieved a 100% score. 

## Background ##

My current haskell knowledge based of University of Zagreb course **Programming in Haskell** 2017./2018.
More details available on [course website](www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/puh/) 
and [my repo](https://github.com/FilipBolt/puh) with solutions for problems in the course.
